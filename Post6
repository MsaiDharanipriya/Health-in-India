<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hip-joint-replacement">hip replacement</a>&nbsp;is a procedure where a surgeon replaces damaged and worn-out surfaces in your hip with new artificial surfaces. Surgeons&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507864/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most oftenTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;perform it to treat pain and loss of hip function caused by advanced osteoarthritis.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Total hip replacement is the most extensive version of this surgery. In a total hip replacement, your surgeon will replace the head of your femur and the socket of your hip joint. Experts expect that the number of people in the United States with total hip replacements will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jrheum.org/content/early/2019/04/09/jrheum.170990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly triple</a>&nbsp;by 2040.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If only part of your hip is damaged, a doctor or healthcare professional may recommend less extensive procedures such as partial replacement or resurfacing. Partial hip replacement involves replacing the head of your femur. Hip resurfacing involves covering the head of your femur with an artificial covering.</p>

<h3>Parts of a hip replacement</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total hip replacement replaces your entire hip joint. The replacement is made up of four parts:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Cup or socket:</strong>&nbsp;A cup-shaped artificial piece replaces the socket of your hip (acetabulum).</li><li><strong>Cup lining:</strong>&nbsp;A liner reduces the friction between the ball and socket of your hip.</li><li><strong>Femoral head:</strong>&nbsp;A ball replaces the round head at the top of your femur.</li><li><strong>Femoral stem:</strong>&nbsp;A stem connects the ball to your thighbone.</li></ul>

<h2><a>What are the options for total hip replacement?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hip replacement implants are available in different materials. Factors such as your age, the cost, and your activity level determine which option is best for you. Opinions on the best material vary between surgeons.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following types are or were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/metal-metal-hip-implants/general-information-about-hip-implants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approvedTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;in the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Metal-on-polyethylene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball of the implant is made of metal, and the socket is made of or lined with a type of plastic called polyethylene. These implants were most common up to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6384837/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">middle of the 1990sTrusted Source</a>.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They’re still quite common and work for all types of people. But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4324779/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some researchTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;suggests that other types may be better suited to younger, more active people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ceramic-on-polyethylene</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball of the implant is ceramic, and the socket is made of plastic or lined with polyethylene. It remains the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most popular choiceTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;due to its high resistance to wear and lower risk of corrosion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ceramic-on-ceramic</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball of the implant is ceramic, and the socket is lined with ceramic. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7814309/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 studyTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;found a lower wear rate in ceramic-on-ceramic implants at a 10-year follow-up than in ceramic-on-polyethylene. Although this type lasts longer than other types, there’s a risk of squeaking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the main concerns is persistent squeaking, which various studies report occur in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5367589/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">0% to 33%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Ceramic-on-metal</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ball of the implant is ceramic, and the socket is lined with metal. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25737511/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2015 studyTrusted Source</a>, researchers concluded that they wouldn’t recommend ceramic-on-metal due to higher-than-expected levels of metal ions in the blood. This type is uncommon in the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Metal-on-metal</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Metal-on-metal implants were common until 2016 in the United States. They stopped being FDA-approved in 2016 due to unsatisfactory results and the production of small metal particles. In the early to mid-2000s, they made up about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6384837/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-thirdTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of hip implants in the United States.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is the procedure for a total hip replacement?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total hip replacement usually takes about&nbsp;<a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 to 2 hours</a>. You’ll receive a general anesthetic through an intravenous (IV) line and will be asleep during your procedure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Surgeons use various surgical techniques to insert the implant. Each approach has its benefits and risks. Research hasn’t shown one approach to be better than the others.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Posterior approach</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The posterior approach was traditionally the most common technique. During this procedure, the surgeon makes an incision on the back of your leg close to your buttocks and cuts through your gluteus maximus muscle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8601379/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 review of studiesTrusted Source</a>, researchers found very strong evidence that the posterior approach is associated with shorter operative time. But the anterior approach may decrease the length of your hospital stay and provide greater short-term restoration of function.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Direct anterior</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>During the direct anterior method, a surgeon makes an incision at the front of your hip. The surgeon pushes aside the muscle and tendons to access your joint.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Direct lateral</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>According to a 2015 study, about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373995/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">60%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of Canadian surgeons use the direct lateral technique. During this approach, the surgeon makes an incision on the side of your hip. They’ll detach the tendons of the gluteus medius muscle to access your joint capsule.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Before your total hip replacement surgery</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The following steps can help you prepare for your procedure:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Find a driver for after your procedure.</li><li>Quit smoking if you do.</li><li>Maintain a moderate weight.</li><li>If you have diabetes, ensure that it’s under control.</li><li>Tell the surgeon about any medications and supplements you’re taking.</li><li>Follow the surgeon’s advice about when you need to stop eating and drinking.</li><li>Add grab bars or railings to your bathroom and make other changes to your home to make getting around easier while you’re recovering.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What are the risks of total hip replacement surgery?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like with every surgical procedure, a total hip replacement comes with some risk. Serious complications such as infection occur in less than&nbsp;<a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2%</a>&nbsp;of people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>What is recovery like after total hip replacement?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Following the surgeon’s recovery instructions can give you the best chance of a smooth recovery. Most people can resume light activity about&nbsp;<a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3 to 6 weeks</a>&nbsp;after surgery. The surgeon may recommend:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>pain relievers such as opioids,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/side-effects-from-nsaids">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/pain-relief/acetaminophen-tylenol-side-effects">acetaminophen</a>&nbsp;(Tylenol)</li><li>having your stitches removed after about 2 weeks</li><li>eating a balanced diet with an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/iron-supplements-who-should-take">iron supplement</a>&nbsp;to promote healing</li><li>drinking plenty of fluids</li></ul>

<h2><a>What precautions should I take after a total hip replacement?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/recovery/activities-after-hip-replacement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons</a>&nbsp;recommends asking a doctor if you should avoid the following while you’re still recovering:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>crossing your legs at the knee for 6 to 8 weeks</li><li>bringing your knee higher than your hip</li><li>leaning forward while sitting</li><li>picking something off the floor from a seated position</li><li>turning your feet inward or outward when bending down</li><li>reaching down to pull up blankets in bed</li><li>bending at the waist beyond 90 degrees</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Talk with your dentist</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s important to tell a dentist about your hip replacement before undergoing any dental procedures. Some dental procedures can cause bacteria to travel through your blood and settle in your artificial joint, which may increase your risk of infection. The dentist may recommend taking antibiotics before your procedure to lower this risk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Are there alternatives to total hip replacement?</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/hemiarthroplasty">Hemiarthroplasty</a>, or a partial hip replacement, is a simpler surgery with a shorter surgery time. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5407395/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018 studyTrusted Source</a>, researchers found partial replacement was associated with a significantly lower need for readjustment surgery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Resurfacing is an even less invasive procedure. It involves replacing only the surface of your femur.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But resurfacing comes with its own&nbsp;<a href="https://aoj.amegroups.com/article/view/5437/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risks</a>. Most resurfacing procedures involve metal-on-metal surfaces. Surgeons rarely pursue this option because of the risk of metal corrosion and debris.</p>

<h2><a>Frequently asked questions</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here are some frequently asked questions people have about total hip replacements:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>What is the success rate for total hip replacement surgery?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many studies have found that more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6512562/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of people experience pain relief for at least 10 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>Can I have both hips replaced at the same time?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You can have hip replacement surgery on both hips at the same time or one at a time. Both hips at the same time is called a bilateral procedure.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you have both hips replaced at the same time, the surgery will take about twice as long. There’s also a&nbsp;<a href="https://josr-online.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13018-018-1058-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher riskTrusted Source</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-attack/hip-replacement-and-heart-attack">heart attack</a>, stroke, and blood clots.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>How long do hip replacements last?</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a 2019 review, researchers found that about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6376618/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">58%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;of hip replacements last 25 years. In a 2021 study, researchers found a lifetime risk of revision surgery of&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33641431/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27.6%Trusted Source</a>&nbsp;in people ages 46 to 50 years, which decreased to 1.1% in people older than 90 years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h2><a>Takeaway</a></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A total hip replacement is a procedure where a surgeon replaces the ball and socket of your hip with implants. It’s a common treatment for late stage osteoarthritis and other conditions that cause hip pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A doctor can help you figure out if you’re a good candidate for a hip replacement. Some people can benefit from less invasive procedures such as a partial hip replacement or resurfacing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There are several different approaches to total hip replacement surgery. They each have their benefits and risks, and no one is better than the other. What’s most important is to find a surgeon you’re confident in.</p>
